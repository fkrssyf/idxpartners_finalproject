# Data Scientist ID/X Partners Project-based Virtual Internship 2024
End-to-end Solution (Prediction Model) Final Project for ID/X Partners Project-based Virtual Internship by Rakamin Academy.

# Task Introduction
Before working on Task 5, ensure that you have mastered all the material discussed from week 1 to week 4. Task 5 is the final assignment where you need to work on the given project by creating an end-to-end solution.
# Background
As the final assignment of your internship as a Data Scientist at ID/X Partners, you will be involved in a project for a lending company. You will collaborate with various other departments in this project to provide a technological solution for the company. You are required to build a model that can predict credit risk using a dataset provided by the company, which consists of accepted and rejected loan data. Additionally, you need to prepare visual media to present the solution to the client. Ensure that the visual media you create is clear, easy to read, and communicative. This end-to-end solution can be implemented in the programming language of your choice while adhering to Data Science frameworks/methodologies.

Your task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict credit risk based on the provided dataset, which includes data on approved and rejected loans. In developing the model, you also need to carry out several stages starting with Data Understanding, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, Data Modelling, and Evaluation.
